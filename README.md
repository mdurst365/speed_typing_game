# Speed Typing Game

This project is a tutorial that I completed to get additional practice outside of OSU coding bootcamp. This project is a game that lets the user type out API generated quotes while a JavaScript timer records how long it takes the user to make an exact match.

# Concepts covered in this tutorial include
- How to use fetch to query an API
- How to efficiently load JavaScript
- How to handle asynchronous JavaScript
-  How to bind click and input events in JavaScript
